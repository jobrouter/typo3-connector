Introduction
============

`JobRouter速 <https://www.jobrouter.com/>`_ is a scalable digitisation platform
which links processes, data and documents. The TYPO3 extension `TYPO3 JobRouter
Connector <https://github.com/brotkrueml/typo3-jobrouter-connector>`_ links
TYPO3 with the JobRouter速 platform.

What does it do?
================

The TYPO3 JobRouter Connector is a base extension for defining connections
from TYPO3 to JobRouter速. Other extensions rely on this extension to add further
functionality:

- :doc:`Connect JobData tables with TYPO3 <typo3-jobrouter-data:introduction>`
- :doc:`Connect JobRouter速 processes with TYPO3 <typo3-jobrouter-process:introduction>`

This extension uses the :doc:`JobRouter Client <jobrouter-client:introduction>`
library.
